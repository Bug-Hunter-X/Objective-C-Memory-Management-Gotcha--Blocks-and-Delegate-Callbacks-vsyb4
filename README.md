# Objective-C Memory Management Issue: Blocks and Delegates

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle issue in Objective-C related to memory management and object lifecycles when using blocks and delegate callbacks.  Improper handling of object ownership can lead to unexpected crashes due to premature deallocation.

## Problem

The core problem lies in the interaction between object lifecycles and the scope of blocks or asynchronous delegate callbacks.  If an object's retain count changes within a block, and the outer object releasing it finishes execution before the block, the object referenced within the block can be deallocated prematurely, leading to a crash.

## Solution

The solution focuses on using `__weak` or `__strong` references within blocks (avoiding strong references whenever possible) and carefully managing the lifecycle of objects that are passed to delegates or blocks.  Using weak references prevents the block from retaining the object longer than necessary.
